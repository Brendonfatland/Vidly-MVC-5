# Vidly-MVC-5

This is my frist MVC project I've uploaded to Github. In this I've really focused to work on Attribute Routing, Controllers sending
hardcoded data to the View, and the View using Razor to display the data dynamically through various loops. 

This is a fairly simple project that really just works my skills on the MVC frame work. More will come using Entity Frame work and Data Driven applications.
